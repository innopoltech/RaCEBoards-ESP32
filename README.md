RaCEboards - The Electronics for Your Project

**RaCEboards** is the *electronic brain* of your device, whether it's a rover, robotic arm, rocket, or airplane model. It's a feature-rich board with multiple sensors that monitors the device's status and runs the algorithm you programmed. A universal controller for hands-on learning of electronics, electrical engineering, and programming within project-based activities.

**RaCEboards** consists of 4 core boards stacked like a "sandwich." You can easily rearrange the boards or exclude one or more from the stackâ€”it will remain fully functional!

The current version of **RaCEboards** is **v0.4**.

**RaCEboards v0.4 Stack:**
+   **MCU v0.4** - Microcontroller Board
+   **PWR v0.4** - Power Management & DC Motor/Servo Driver Board
+   **MEMS v0.4** - Sensors and Expansion Board
+   **GNSS v0.4** - Navigation and Wireless Communication Board
+   **CPM v0.4** - BLDC Power Distribution Board *(test version)*
+   **AUX v0.4** - Audio Board *(test version)*
+   **TP v0.4** - Breadboard *(test version)*
